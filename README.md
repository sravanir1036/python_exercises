I have used `xml.etree.ElementTree` python library to read, modify and create xml files. input file is in /xmlfiles directory and output file will be generated and stored in the same directory.
## Exercise 2

I have used `json` python library to read, modify and create json files. input file is in /jsonfiles directory and output file will be generated and stored in the same directory.
## Exercise 3
### Create a python script that parses jmeter log files in CSV format, and in the case if there are any non-successful endpoint responses recorded in the log, prints out the label, response code, response message, failure message, and the time of non-200 response in human-readable format in PST timezone (e.g. 2021-02-09 06:02:55 PST).
